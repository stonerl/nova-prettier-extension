## 3.5.49 - 2025-06-21

- Updated `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to version `0.6.13`

## 3.5.48 - 2025-06-06

- Updated `prettier-plugin-java` to version `2.6.8`

## 3.5.47 - 2025-06-01

## 3.5.46 - 2025-05-29

### Changed

- Clarified permission usage in `README.md` by detailing the `Launch Subprocesses`
  and `Read Files` requirements.

## 3.5.45 - 2025-05-24

### Changed

- **Print Width toggle limits**
  - Enforced a minimum value of `60` and a maximum value of `140`
    when using the Print Width toggle in the UI.
  - Higher or lower values can still be entered manually in the settings.

## 3.5.44 - 2025-05-24

### Changed

- **SQL & TOML cursor tracking**
  - Replaced dummy `locStart: () => -1` / `locEnd: () => -1` with
    `locStart: () => 0` and `locEnd: () => MAX_*_FILE_SIZE` in both
    `prettier-plugin-sql` and `prettier-plugin-toml`.
  - Ensures Prettier’s cursor logic always returns a defined (non-`undefined`) position.

### Added

- **Cursor fallback**
  - In the editor integration, if Prettier fails to compute a position (`null`/`undefined`),
    fall back to `editor.selectedRange.start`.

## 3.5.43 - 2025-05-20

### Changed

- Updated `prettier-plugin-sql` to version `0.19.1`
- Updated `prettier-plugin-toml` to version `2.0.5`
- Switched from `.cjs` to `.js` modules for compatibility with ES modules for both plugins

## 3.5.42 - 2025-05-20

### Hotfix

- Downgrade `prettier-plugin-sql` to version `0.19.0`.
- Downgrade `prettier-plugin-toml` to version `2.0.4`.

The latest plugin releases resulted in a "No parser for …" error.

## 3.5.41 - 2025-05-18

### Changed

- Updated`prettier-plugin-sql` to version `0.19.1`.
- Updated`prettier-plugin-toml` to version `2.0.5`.
- Missing parser and ignored syntax logs appear as info now, w/o the need to
  enable debug logging

## 3.5.40 – 2025-05-07

### Added

- **Centralized Notification Handling**
  - Introduced `notifications.js` to encapsulate all Nova `NotificationRequest` logic.
  - Provides `showNotification()` for posting UI notifications with optional actions and callbacks.
  - Provides `cancelNotification()` to dismiss notifications by ID.

### Refactored

- **Notification API**
  - Notification fields like `type`, `placeholder`, and `inputValue` are now only set when explicitly defined.
  - Results in cleaner, more predictable UI behavior.
  - Simplified notification calls throughout the codebase for improved maintainability and testability.

## 3.5.39 – 2025-05-06

### Development

- Added ESLint as a dev dependency and linted the entire codebase.
- Applied ESLint auto-fixes and suppressed false-positive warnings (e.g., unused variables).
- Added `eslint-config-prettier` and aligned ESLint rules with Prettier’s formatting.

### Refactored

- Consolidated plugin-loading logic into a lookup map for clearer, DRY syntax-to-plugin resolution.

## 3.5.38 – 2025-05-05

### Added

- Stale-response cancellation for Prettier: track in-flight requests per file
  URI and ignore outdated replies
- JSON-RPC handler unsubscription API and automatic unpipe/destroy on fatal parser errors

### Changed

- **JSON-RPC parser**: revamped to a buffer-of-buffers strategy, dynamic
  `\r?\n\r?\n` header detection, stale-byte pruning, proper callback error
  signaling, optional logger injection and full JSDoc typings
- **Formatter**: centralized all flags and readiness checks in private
  `_formatEditor`, enforced mutual-exclusivity of `forced`, `isSaving` and
  `selectionOnly`, and simplified command handlers to one-liners
- **Bootstrap**: dropped all `prettier-eslint` support/detection and streamlined
  startup to only require PrettierService

### Performance

- JSON-RPC header parsing now uses `Buffer.indexOf`
  (no intermediate ASCII strings or regex), cutting allocations and GC pressure

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc for JSON-RPC constants/methods, PrettierService’s
  public API (`format`, `hasConfig`, `getConfig`) and private helpers
- Updated Help section to clarify that `prettier-eslint` is unsupported and
  direct ESLint should be used

## 3.5.37 – 2025‑05‑02

### Added

- **Plugin: `prettier-plugin-toml`**
  Enables formatting support for `.toml` files.

- **Help Section**
  A dedicated Help Section has been added, accessible via
  `Extensions → Prettier⁺ → Prettier⁺ Help`.

## 3.5.36 – 2025‑05‑01

### Fixed

- **SQL Cursor Position**
  - Resolved an issue where formatting SQL files would reset the cursor to the
    start of the document.
    The extension now preserves the editor's current cursor position since
    `prettier-plugin-sql` always returns `0` as the cursor offset.

- **Save Stall Prevention**
  - Fixed a bug where Nova could hang on save if the Prettier service wasn’t ready.
    Formatting now waits for proper initialization before attaching to save events.

### Added

- **Missing Runtime Detection**
  - A user-friendly error dialog now informs users if Node.js or npm is missing,
    with guidance on installing Node.js and updating the system `PATH`.

### Improved

- **Startup Resilience & Logging**
  - Prevented a potential infinite loop on configuration changes during startup.
  - Logged both the extension and Nova versions at launch for easier debugging.
  - Detected and cached the system `npm --version` for improved diagnostics.
  - Renamed internal version helper for better clarity (`isAtLeast` → `minNovaVersion`).

## 3.5.35 - 2025-04-30

### Fixed

- **Lint Feedback**: Fixed an issue where lint errors from Prettier were not
  forwarded to Nova’s issue panel. These are now correctly surfaced in-editor.

## 3.5.34 – 2025‑04‑30

### Refactored

- **Prettier Service, JSON-RPC, and Formatter Resilience**
  - Major internal rewrite of the JSON-RPC layer and service lifecycle
  - `json-rpc.js`
    - Rewritten as a `Transform` stream for proper stream piping
    - Header normalization, improved framing via `Buffer.indexOf`
    - Enforces JSON-RPC 2.0 spec (validates `jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`)
    - Supports batch requests and emits multiple messages per chunk
    - Handles parse errors gracefully (no more hard exits on invalid input)
    - Respects back-pressure on writes using `'drain'` events
  - `prettier-service.js`
    - Service startup now awaits a handshake via `notify('didStart')`
    - Gracefully handles bootstrap errors via `notify('startDidFail')`
    - Centralized and simplified `SIGTERM` handler
  - `formatter.js`
    - Ensures `isReady` before each call to prevent premature RPC use
    - Catches all IPC errors in `format()` and `hasConfig()` to avoid crashes

- **Max Payload Size**
  - Parser now enforces a 32 MiB limit on incoming JSON-RPC payloads

- **Lint Feedback**
  - Lint errors from Prettier are now passed through to Nova’s issue providers
    for in-editor feedback

### Fixed

- **Formatter Safety Checks**
  - Skips formatting if no `syntaxKey` could be determined
  - Prevents writing `undefined` or empty output to avoid file erasure

## 3.5.33 – 2025‑04‑28

### Improved

- **Prettier service lifecycle and stability**
  - Optimized startup, shutdown, and crash recovery behavior
  - Faster, more reliable restarts when configuration or project dependencies change
  - Reduced unnecessary restarts on clean exits

- **Debouncing and file watching**
  - Smarter debouncing with separate timing for file and settings changes
  - Improved handling of external Prettier config files and custom config paths
  - All watchers and listeners are now properly cleaned up on extension shutdown

- **Logging**
  - Added detailed logs for service startup, shutdown timing, and crash detection
  - Improved visibility into module loading failures

## 3.5.32 — 2025-04-27

### Removed

- Eliminated the now-redundant `write` entitlement,
  since migrations fully leverage Nova’s config APIs.

## 3.5.31 - 2025-04-26

### Added

- **Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-twig`**
  Enables formatting support for `.twig` files.

## 3.5.30 - 2025-04-25

### Added

- **SQL Dialect Detection Based on File Extension**
  - Maps known SQL-related extensions to supported sql-formatter dialects.
  - Prioritizes longest-match extension resolution for accuracy (e.g., `.mariadb.sql` over `.sql`).
  - Falls back to a generic 'sql' dialect when no match is found.
  - Extracted `extractPath` into shared helpers for reuse across modules.
  - Adds support for node-sql-parser dialect detection and compatibility.
  - Normalizes incompatible dialects (e.g., 'tsql' → 'transactsql') before parser invocation.
  - Falls back to 'sql' if the dialect is unsupported by node-sql-parser to ensure safe parsing.
  - Centralizes dialect validation and normalization logic in `sql.js` for a clean formatter integration.

- **Support for Nova's SQL Language Extension**
  - When Nova's SQL Language extension is installed, the provided syntax is now used for dialect detection instead of resolving via the URI.

## 3.5.29 – 2025‑04‑23

### Added

- **Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-astro`**
  Enables formatting support for `.astro` files using the official Astro plugin.

- **Expanded SQL extension detection**
  Added more file extensions that trigger SQL formatting in Advanced Syntax Detection.

### Changed

- Updated German translations

## 3.5.28 – 2025‑04‑22

### Added

- **Advanced Syntax Detection**

  Prettier⁺ no longer relies solely on Nova's reported syntax.
  It now intelligently determines the correct syntax based on file extensions—ensuring accurate
  formatting even when language extensions are not installed.
  This behavior can be disabled via the `Advanced Syntax Detection` setting.
  ⚠️ Language extensions are still recommended for best results.

### Changed

- All bundled plugins are now **enabled by default**, except for `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`, which remains optional.

## 3.5.27 - 2025-04-21

### Added

- Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-blade`
  Enables formatting support for Laravel Blade templates.

## 3.5.26 – 2025‑04‑20

### Added

- **Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`**

  Supports Tailwind class sorting in the following syntaxes:
  - HTML
  - HTML (EJS)
  - HTML (Liquid)
  - JavaScript
  - JSX
  - TSX
  - TypeScript

  Each language can be enabled or disabled individually in the extension or project settings.

- **Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-ejs`**
- **Added plugin: `prettier-plugin-ejs-tailwindcss`**
- **Ignore list updated**
  - Added `HTML (EJS)`, `HTML (ERB)` and `TSX` to the ignored syntaxes

### Changed

- **Prettier plugin list now sorted alphabetically**
  - Improves discoverability and consistency across plugin menus
- **Refactored Prettier config sanitization**
  - Replaced manual JSON editing with Nova’s `Config` API
  - Workspace settings are now safely updated using `config.set()`/`config.remove()`
    instead of modifying files directly

### Refactored

- **Prettier config loading logic**
  - Introduced `loadPluginConfig()` helper
  - All plugin-specific config getters (`getDefaultConfig`, `getPhpConfig`, etc.)
    now use this helper
  - Automatically filters out `null`/`undefined` options from config

## 3.5.25 – 2025‑04‑19

### Added

- Added support for Liquid via `prettier-plugin-liquid`. Ensure the
  [Liquid Extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/me.arthr/me.arthr.Liquid/)
  is installed before enabling this plugin.

### Fixed

- Included missing plugin options for:
  - **@prettier/prettier-plugin-php**:
    - printWidth
    - tabWidth
    - useTabs
    - singleQuote
    - requirePragma
    - insertPragma
  - **@prettier/prettier-plugin-xml**:
    - bracketSameLine
    - printWidth
    - singleAttributePerLine
    - tabWidth
  - **prettier-plugin-sql**:
    - updated DB strings
  - **prettier-plugin-nginx**:
    - printWidth
    - tabWidth
    - useTabs

## 3.5.24 – 2025‑04‑18

### Removed

- Fully removed the deprecated Prettier option `jsxBracketSameLine` (this time for real…)

### Added

- **Full cleanup on extension deactivate**
  - Capture and store all `Disposable` handles (file watchers, commands, editor listeners, config observers, etc.)
  - Introduce `PrettierExtension.dispose()` to:
    - Stop the Prettier subprocess
    - Dispose watchers, commands, save‑listeners, debounce timer, and config observers
  - Reset all internal collections after disposal to avoid any stale references

### Changed

- **Add a `hasStarted` flag**
  - Prevents `modulePathDidChange()` from running during
    startup while config observers are being registered
  - Ensures the resolver only kicks in after the extension has fully initialized

## 3.5.23 - 2025-04-17

### Fixed

- Re-added `jsxBracketSameLine` ~for compatibility with plugins that still depend
  on it, despite upstream deprecation.~

## 3.5.22 - 2025-04-17

### Added

- **Full German localization**
  - All strings now translated — **100% complete** via Weblate.

### Removed

- **Deprecated Prettier option: `jsxBracketSameLine`**
  - Removed per upstream deprecation.

### Changed

- **Switched to Babel AST for localization extraction**
  - Uses `@babel/parser` and `@babel/traverse` to extract `nova.localize()` calls.
  - Supports multi-table output: calls with a third argument go into separate files
    (e.g. `notification.json`), others default to `strings.json`.
  - Merges unified configuration and extension metadata into the default localization table.

- **Proper logging**
  - Replaced raw `console` calls with `log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error`, and `log.debug`.
  - Debug logs now require “Log Debug Information” to be enabled.

- **Refactored i18n**
  - Made remaining notification strings translatable.

## 3.5.21 - 2025-04-16

### Changed

- Renamed the extension to **Prettier⁺** — because it just looks better 😎
- updated `prettier-plugin-sql` to version `0.19.0`
- updated `rollup` to version `4.4.0`

## 3.5.20 - 2025-04-15

### Added

- **New command: Restart Prettier Service**
  - Available via `Extensions > Prettier⁺ > Restart Prettier Service` (**⌃⇧⌘R**)
  - Allows manually restarting the Prettier service without restarting Nova

### Changed

- **Prettier service now restarts automatically**
  - Triggered on relevant module or settings changes:
    - running `npm install` (adds or removes Prettier)
    - setting/unsetting a global Prettier path
    - toggling the “Prefer Bundled Prettier” option
  - No need to restart Nova anymore — Prettier⁺ will pick up the correct module on its own

### Fixed

- **Crash on rapid Prettier restarts**
  - Fixed a `ReferenceError` caused by incorrect access to `_isStoppedPromise` during service startup

## 3.5.19 - 2025-04-14

> Note: Version 3.5.19 replaces 3.5.18, which was briefly released but promptly
> withdrawn after it failed to fully resolve the issue it aimed to fix.

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash when formatting `.vue` files without a cursor set

## 3.5.17 - 2025-04-14

### Added

- **New option: `Ignore Configuration`**
  - When enabled, external configuration files (e.g. `.prettierrc`) are ignored
  - The extension’s default settings and plugin options are always applied

- **Custom Prettier configuration file support**
  - A custom configuration file can now be set in the extension or project settings
  - This file takes precedence over any configuration files in the workspace
  - Supersedes the `Ignore Configuration` option when both are used

- **New option: `Prefer Bundled Prettier`**
  - Forces the extension to always use its bundled Prettier modules
  - Has no effect when a custom module path is set

### Fixed

- **Respect project Prettier config when loading plugin options**
  - Plugin-specific options are now only applied when no project configuration file is found
  - Prevents unintentional overrides from plugin defaults when using `.prettierrc` or similar files

## 3.5.16 - 2025-04-13

### Added

- New Command: **Format Document (Forced)** — formats the current file even if its
  syntax is ignored or excluded via `.prettierignore`.

### Changed

- Dismissing the warning shown when using _Format Selection_ on unsupported syntaxes
  now disables the command for those syntaxes.
- Refined user-facing notifications for unsupported syntaxes and reset actions
- Internal: Refactored plugin and Prettier options handling

## 3.5.15 - 2025-04-12

### Added

- **Automatic package and patch management**
  - Implemented a module resolver to validate all dependencies declared in `package.json`
  - Automatically runs `npm install` for any missing or outdated packages
  - Applies patches using `patch-package` after every install
  - Ensures patches are reapplied even when no packages are updated

- **Syntax restriction for "Format Selection"**
  - Limited "Format Selection" to syntaxes supported by Prettier’s `formatWithCursor`:
    JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Handlebars
  - This restriction is due to upstream limitations in Prettier's cursor handling logic
  - Displays a dismissible warning when attempting to format unsupported syntaxes
  - Added command: **Reset Syntax Warnings for Prettier⁺** to restore suppressed messages

### Fixed

- **Prevent crash in `locStart` / `locEnd`**
  - Added null-safe checks and fallback handling to avoid crashes when a node lacks location data
  - This issue occurred in the XML plugin and previously prevented XML files from being formatted
  - Prevents `formatWithCursor` from throwing TypeErrors on malformed AST nodes

## 3.5.14 - 2025-04-09

> Note: This version supersedes 3.5.13, which was briefly published and then
> withdrawn due to a forgotten code update.

### Changed

- Switched to Prettier’s native `formatWithCursor` for cursor preservation during formatting.
- Removed the custom diff-based cursor logic and `fast-diff` dependency.
- Cursor handling is now handled by Prettier directly, making the code simpler and more reliable.
- Editor now automatically scrolls to the restored cursor position after formatting.

### Performance

- Formatting is now **dramatically faster**.
- A 49,395-character JSON file that previously took **30 seconds** to format now completes in just **20 milliseconds**.

## 3.5.12 - 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- Corrected option handling for `node-sql-parser`: the extension previously used the wrong configuration key,
  which caused it to parse options for `sql-formatter` instead.

## 3.5.11 - 2025-04-08

### Added

- Full German translation of the UI

### Changed

- Removed the config key `prettier.plugins.prettier-plugin-php.singleQuote`
  (it duplicated `prettier.default-config.singleQuote`)
- Cleaned up descriptions for several options
- Database language names now follow official spelling

All UI elements have been translated into German. If you spot anything awkward or off,
head over to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/prettier-for-nova/) and suggest improvements.

Chinese, French, and Japanese translations still need contributors — feel free to jump in! 😄

## 3.5.10 - 2025-04-06

### Added

- Added support for formatting Java and `.properties` files
- Included `prettier-plugin-java` for Java source formatting
- Included `prettier-plugin-properties` for Java-style `.properties` configuration files

See the README for usage details.

## 3.5.9 - 2025-04-05

### Changed

- `workspaceConfig` keys now use boolean values instead of enums:
  - `Enable` → `true`
  - `Disable` → `false`
  - `Global Default` → key removed to fall back to global settings
- Compatibility with the original enum-based behavior is preserved
- Extension permission for filesystem access has been updated from `readonly` to `readwrite` to enable migration of project configuration files

### Added

- Existing project configs (`.nova/Configuration.json`) are now automatically migrated to the new boolean format on startup
- A notification is shown if any project config values were changed during migration

## 3.5.8 - 2025-04-03

### Changed

- Updated README and LICENSE

## 3.5.7 - 2025-04-02

### Changed

- Restores the internal enum keys (`Enable`, `Disable`, `Global Default`) while keeping the original
  workspace config UI label values (`Enabled`, `Disabled`, `Global Setting`).
  This ensures compatibility with the original extension, allowing Prettier⁺ to be used as a drop-in replacement.
  _Note: If you previously used custom values in your workspace config, you may need to update them manually._

## 3.5.6 - 2025-04-02

### Added

- activationEvents: Prettier⁺ now uses conditional activation. It won’t run
  unless it finds a supported config file (like `.prettierrc`) in the project
  root.
- Localization groundwork: Initial translation support has been implemented.
  Translations can be contributed via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/prettier-for-nova/)

### Fixed

- Plugin option mapping: NGINX and SQL plugin options (specifically for node-sql-parser)
  were being mishandled—this has now been corrected.

## 3.5.5 - 2025-04-01

### Added

- added new Prettier option: `objectWrap`
